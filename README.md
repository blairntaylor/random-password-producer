#### Putting The Second Week Together

Homework 2 README.md file

Some of my challenges included:

1. Figuring out where the starter code should code and where my code related.
2. I understand small code blocks but not how to get them to all work together.
3. My code is long and itemized. Other coders are able to create a block that does multiple things but I have each action written out.
4. I found this homework to be very challenging and will RESUBMIT after I am able to go back over the current weeks class videos.

I have plenty of pseudo code in my CSS but couldn't figure out all of teh functions, methods and how to utilize some of the special thing like getting a user input and check it aginst the criteria of =< 8 and >= 128.
